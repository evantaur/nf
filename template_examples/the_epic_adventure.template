The epic adventure of <|name[desc=your name|require]|>.
############################################
You find yourself standing at the entrance of a dark cave. The entrance is guarded by a fierce-looking troll.

"Who goes there?" the troll growls. "State your name and purpose!"

You introduce yourself as <|name[desc=your name|require]|>, a brave adventurer in search of treasure.

The troll eyes you suspiciously, but then nods its head. "Very well. You may enter, but be warned: this cave is filled with dangers at every turn."

You step inside the cave and your eyes slowly adjust to the dim light. You can see several paths branching off in different directions.

As you make your way deeper into the cave, you hear strange noises coming from all around you. The air is thick with the scent of must and decay. You feel a cold shiver run down your spine.

As you continue on, you come across a point where the cave splits in two directions.

You choose <|path[desc=which direction to go|select=( left,right)|default=1|require]|> path and continue on, determined to find the treasure hidden deep within the cave.

Suddenly, you hear a voice coming from the darkness. "Who dares to enter my domain?" it booms. "Show yourself!"

You draw your <|weapon[desc=weapon to use in battle|default=banana|require]|> and step forward, ready for a fight.

The creature emerges from the shadows, revealing itself to be a <|monster[desc=monster type you fought|select=(goblin,orc,troll)|default=0|require]|>. You engage in a fierce battle, your <|weapon[desc=weapon you chose|default=banana|require]|> clashing against its razor-sharp claws.

After defeating the creature, you find a hidden passage leading deeper into the cave. You follow it, hoping it will lead you to the treasure.

As you walk, you notice <|markings[desc=give an adjective|default=strange|require]|> markings on the walls. They seem to be pointing in a certain direction.

You follow the markings and eventually come to a large chamber. In the center of the chamber sits a <|treasure[desc=type of treasure you found|select={"pile of gold coins":"We're rich!","ancient artifact":"I wonder if it has magical properties?" ,"enchanted amulet": "+5 stamina","sack of potatoes":"Yummy!"}|default=3|require]|>. You smile triumphantly, knowing that your bravery has paid off.

You grab the treasure and make your way back to the entrance of the cave. As you step out into the sunlight, you hear the troll's voice behind you.

"Did you find what you were looking for?" it asks.

You turn to face the troll and hold up your treasure. "Yes, I did," you say. "And I couldn't have done it without your warning."

The troll nods, a small smile on its face. "I knew you were brave," it says. "Take care on your next adventure."

You nod and walk away, eager to see where your next adventure will take you.
